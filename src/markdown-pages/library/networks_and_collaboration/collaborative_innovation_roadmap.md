"We call our approach 'Collaborative Innovation'. We're using it to solve a range of tough problems like revitalizing economically distressed communities, building value chains for regenerative agriculture, expanding employee ownership, and eliminating hazardous chemicals from electronics manufacturing. Our approach creates high-trust collaborations that produce results fast and drive systemic change." This was one of the key papers for me to link the practical activity of mapping (the system) to convening networks.
