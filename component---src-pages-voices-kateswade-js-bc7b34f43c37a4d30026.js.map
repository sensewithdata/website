There is lots of data on land out there but it (even the open government data) is often hard to understand for non-experts and most services making it easier to understand have a high price tag. We developed <a href=\"http://www.landexplorer.cc/\">www.landexplorer.cc</a> as a response to this but it has been really hard to find funding and a sustainable business model for a platform like this, especially because we want to keep it “in the commons” and not raise private equity finance.</p>\n        <p> We were really excited, then, to form a collaboration with the Solidarity Economy Association whose <a href=\"https://mersey-green.solidarityeconomy.coop\">SEA-map software</a> helps local organisations map the solidarity economy in their areas. We both believe that data is a common good and should be easily accessible.</p>\n      </ContentBlock>\n      <ContentBlock>\n          <h3>Introducing Digital Commons</h3>\n          <p>Digital Commons is a new platform cooperative, a community benefit society.
